# Inner Five Server Bug Report

## üö® Critical Issue: analyze_all API Using Wrong Date for Analysis

### Problem Summary
The `analyze_all` API endpoint is incorrectly using current date (year, month, day) instead of user's birth data for eidos analysis. **Current date should ONLY be used for daily fortune features, NOT for eidos personality analysis.**

### Correct Usage of Dates
- **Birth Data (birth_year, birth_month, birth_day, birth_hour, birth_minute)**: Should be used for Inner Compass eidos analysis
- **Current Date (year, month, day)**: Should ONLY be used for "Today's Fortune" feature on home screen

### Expected Behavior for analyze_all
- Use birth_year, birth_month, birth_day, birth_hour, birth_minute for eidos calculations
- Each user gets unique eidos type based on their birth information
- Same birth data should always produce same eidos type (consistency)
- Different birth data should produce different eidos types (personalization)

### Current Broken Behavior
- Server ignores birth data completely
- Uses current date (year, month, day) for eidos analysis
- All users get identical eidos types: "The Passionate Seeker of Radiant Creator"
- When current date changes, eidos type changes (this is wrong!)

### Test Evidence

#### Proof 1: Birth Data Ignored
```json
// Different birth years, same current date
{
  "name": "User A",
  "birth_year": 1990,  // ‚Üê Should affect result
  "birth_month": 1,
  "birth_day": 1,
  "year": 2025,        // ‚Üê Currently used (wrong!)
  "month": 6,
  "day": 15
}

{
  "name": "User B", 
  "birth_year": 1975,  // ‚Üê Should affect result
  "birth_month": 12,
  "birth_day": 31,
  "year": 2025,        // ‚Üê Currently used (wrong!)
  "month": 6,
  "day": 15
}

// Both return: "The Passionate Seeker of Radiant Creator" (WRONG!)
```

#### Proof 2: Current Date Controls Result
```json
// Same birth data, different current dates
{
  "birth_year": 1990,
  "birth_month": 5,
  "birth_day": 15,
  "year": 2025,        // Current date 1
  "month": 6,
  "day": 15
}
// Result: "The Passionate Seeker of Radiant Creator"

{
  "birth_year": 1990,  // Same birth data
  "birth_month": 5,
  "birth_day": 15,
  "year": 2020,        // Different current date
  "month": 1,
  "day": 1
}
// Result: "The Compassionate Advisor of Wise Guide"
```

This proves server is using current date instead of birth data!

### Required Fix
**For analyze_all endpoint:**
1. ‚úÖ Use birth_year, birth_month, birth_day, birth_hour, birth_minute for eidos calculations
2. ‚ùå Do NOT use current year, month, day for eidos analysis
3. ‚úÖ Current date should only be used for daily fortune features (separate API)

### API Endpoints Clarification
- **analyze_all**: Should use BIRTH data for eidos analysis
- **getDailyFortune**: Should use CURRENT date for daily fortune
- These are different features with different date requirements!

### Impact
üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Inner Compass feature completely broken
- All users get identical results
- Core personalization feature not working
- User experience severely degraded

### Urgency
**IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED** - This breaks the main feature of the app

### Test After Fix
After fixing, these should return DIFFERENT results:
```json
// User 1: Born 1990-01-01
// User 2: Born 1975-12-31  
// User 3: Born 2000-06-15
```

Each should get a unique eidos type based on their birth data, regardless of current date.

### Additional Notes
- Korean names work without "KeyError: 0" (previous issue seems resolved)
- English names also work but produce same results
- Group mapping logic on client side is working correctly
- All other response data structure is correct
