# Inner Five Backend Text Improvement Request

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue: Insufficient Group Descriptions in Inner Compass

### Current Problem
The current group descriptions in the Inner Compass feature are too generic and lack specific details that users need to understand their eidos group classification.

### Current Group Descriptions (Too Generic)
```
Golden Sage: "Beings who design the future with golden wisdom and create wealth and success"
Azure Mystic: "Beings who transcend all limitations to achieve ultimate mastery"
Silver Scholar: "Beings who achieve harmony by integrating spiritual enlightenment with practical abilities"
Green Mercenary: "Beings who harmonize with the forces of nature and pioneer new paths"
```

### What's Missing
Users need to understand:
1. **What the group represents** - Core characteristics and values
2. **What personality traits they have** - Specific behavioral patterns and tendencies
3. **Why they belong to this group** - What aspects of their birth data/personality led to this classification
4. **How this applies to their life** - Practical implications and guidance

### Required Improvements

#### 1. Detailed Group Characteristics
Each group description should include:
- **Core Values**: What drives this group
- **Personality Traits**: Specific behavioral patterns
- **Strengths**: What they excel at
- **Challenges**: Areas for growth
- **Life Approach**: How they typically handle situations

#### 2. Personalized Explanation
For each user, explain:
- **Classification Reasoning**: "You belong to this group because..."
- **Birth Data Connection**: How their birth information connects to group traits
- **Personal Relevance**: Specific ways this applies to their life

#### 3. Enhanced Content Structure
```
