```

## Required Solution

### Add `tarot_insight` Section to Analysis Report

**Required JSON Structure:**
```json
{
  "tarot_insight": {
    "card_name_display": "The Magician",
    "card_meaning": "The Magician represents manifestation, willpower, and the ability to turn ideas into reality. This card signifies that you have all the tools and resources needed to achieve your goals. Your creative power and determination can transform your dreams into tangible results.",
    "card_message_text": "As The Magician, you possess the unique ability to bridge the spiritual and material worlds. Your Eidos essence as 'The Tempered Sword' aligns perfectly with this card's energy of focused intention and decisive action. Trust in your power to manifest your desires through disciplined effort and clear vision.",
    "card_image_url": "https://your-cdn.com/tarot/magician.png",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "Essential Meaning",
        "content": "The Magician card represents your innate ability to manifest your will in the physical world through focused intention and action."
      },
      {
        "title": "Eidos-Destiny Insight: Resonance with Your Essence",
        "content": "Your essence as 'The Tempered Sword' resonates deeply with The Magician's energy of precision, focus, and transformative power."
      },
      {
        "title": "Wisdom and Application",
        "content": "Channel your natural leadership abilities and strategic thinking to create meaningful change in your life and the lives of others."
      },
      {
        "title": "The Shadow to Be Aware Of (A Message of Caution)",
        "content": "Beware of using your power for selfish gains or manipulation. True mastery comes from serving the highest good."
      }
    ],
    "mantra": "I am the master of my destiny. I manifest my highest potential with wisdom and integrity."
  }
}
```

## Personalization Requirements

The `tarot_insight` should be generated based on user's personal data:

### Input Data for Personalization
- **Birth Date**: `1966-03-22`
- **Eidos Type**: `"The Tempered Sword"`
- **Eidos Group**: `"The Verdant Architect: Green Mercenary"`
- **Life Path Number**: `11`
- **Day Master**: `"Metal"`
- **User Name**: For personalized messaging

### Tarot Card Selection Logic
The personal tarot card should be determined by:
1. **User's Eidos Type** (primary factor)
2. **Life Path Number** (secondary factor)
3. **Day Master Element** (tertiary factor)
4. **Birth Date** (for consistency)

**Important**: This should be a **fixed personal tarot card** that doesn't change daily (unlike Today's Tarot which uses date-based randomization).

## Feature Distinction

### Your Tarot vs Today's Tarot
- **Your Tarot**: Uses analysis report `tarot_insight` (fixed personal tarot based on user's core identity)
- **Today's Tarot**: Uses Daily Tarot API (date-based changing tarot with user data + current date)

## Business Impact

### Current User Experience Issue
- Users see generic "The Fool" card with meaningless default message
- No personalized tarot insights based on their unique Eidos profile
- Broken feature reduces app value and user engagement

### Expected Outcome After Fix
- Users receive personalized tarot card matching their Eidos essence
- Detailed, meaningful tarot interpretation relevant to their personality
- Enhanced user engagement with personalized spiritual guidance

## Technical Requirements

### API Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: Analysis report generation (existing)
- **Modification**: Add `tarot_insight` section to response

### Data Validation
- `card_name_display`: Must be valid tarot card name
- `card_meaning`: Minimum 100 characters of meaningful description
- `card_message_text`: Personalized message mentioning user's Eidos type
- `sections`: Array of at least 3-4 insight sections

### Error Handling
- If tarot generation fails, provide fallback with meaningful content
- Avoid "N/A" or empty values that break the user experience

## Priority
**HIGH** - This is a core feature that directly impacts user satisfaction and app functionality.

## Timeline Request
Please prioritize this fix as it affects the primary tarot reading experience for all users.
